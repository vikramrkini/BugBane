breaking_changes:
  - ansible-test - The ``vcenter`` test plugin now defaults to using a user-provided static configuration instead of the ``govcsim`` simulator for collections.
                   Set the ``ANSIBLE_VCSIM_CONTAINER`` environment variable to ``govcsim`` to use the simulator.
                   Keep in mind that the simulator is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
