bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Use consistent file permissions when delegating tests to a container or remote host.
                   Files with any execute bit set will use permissions ``755``.
                   All other files will use permissions ``644``.
                   (Resolves issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75079)
breaking_changes:
  - ansible-test - Integration tests which depend on specific file permissions when running in an ansible-test managed
                   host environment may require changes. Tests that require permissions other than ``755`` or ``644``
                   may need to be updated to set the necessary permissions as part of the test run.
