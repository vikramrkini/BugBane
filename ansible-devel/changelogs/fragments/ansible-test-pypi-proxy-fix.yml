bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Perform PyPI proxy configuration after instances are ready and bootstrapping has been completed.
                   Only target instances are affected, as controller instances were already handled this way.
                   This avoids proxy configuration errors when target instances are not yet ready for use.
