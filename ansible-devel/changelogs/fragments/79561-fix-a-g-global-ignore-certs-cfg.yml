bugfixes:
  - Fix using ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` when downloading tarballs from Galaxy servers (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79557).
  - Fix using ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` in conjunction with collections in requirements files which specify a specific ``source`` that isn't in the configured servers.
