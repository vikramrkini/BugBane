breaking_changes:
  - "ansible-doc - no longer treat plugins in collections whose name starts with ``_`` as deprecated
     (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79217)."
  - "ansible-test sanity - previously plugins and modules in collections whose name started with ``_``
     were treated as deprecated, even when they were not marked as deprecated in ``meta/runtime.yml``.
     This is no longer the case (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79362)."
